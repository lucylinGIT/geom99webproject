        <h1> Editing Application
        </h1>
        <h1> Step 1: Exploring editing applications  
        </h1>
            <p class="text">
                As we are designing this project for GRCA who have ESRI licencing, we explored the ESRI options for editing spatial data.  
            </p>
        
                <h2>Web AppBuilder  
                </h2>
                    <p class="text">
                        A desktop-friendly application, it has a few easily configurable widgets with editing capabilities. The best of these for our purposes was the Batch Attribute Editor, which allows selection and editing of many features from multiple layers using various shape-based selectors. The simplicity of the widgets makes it very easy for a staff member to quickly create updates to several trails at once without having to sort through data as using the Web AppBuilder is as simple as connecting the app to a given web map and choosing which feature layers and fields within those layers on which editing is allowed.  

                        Unfortunately, this application is based on the older Javascript API and will be discontinued in the future. The new ArcGIS Experience Builder based on the latest version of the Javascript API does not have editing functionality as of yet, so Web AppBuilder is our desktop-friendly option. In addition, with the update to Esri’s web maps they are capable editing directly on the map so the use of a web app will likely be unnecessary for the purposes of editing.   
                    </p>
        
                <h2>Field Maps  
                </h2>
                    <p class="text">
                        This mobile app combines a lot of functionality for in-the-field use, including offline map viewing, data collection and editing. The editing is also as simple as loading in a map, selecting individual features and editing their attributes. One downside is that it is geared towards the editing of features one by one like for inspections, so does not have the same batch editing functionality as the web AppBuilder.   
                    </p>
        
        <h1>Step 2: Making an editable layer  
        </h1>
            <p class="text">
                The initial goal for this application is to update a trail layer stored on ArcGIS Server as a feature service. There are two ways to publish an editable feature service: 
                <br>

                    1) Setting the Feature capabilities on the layer when publishing it from ArcGIS Pro 
                <br>
                    2) Changing the service capabilities after publishing through the ArcGIS Server Manager 
                <br>
                    After trying both of these avenues and ensuring that both the ArcGIS Online item and web map linked to that feature service supported editing, our team was still able to edit our layer with any of our editing applications. After some frustration, we learned that a feature service must be stored on an Enterprise geodatabase to allow editing on the web – services stored in a file geodatabase do not. A critical step! 
                <br>
                    For the purposes of this course based on the web development side, we decided to instead host our feature layer on ArcGIS Online which allows the same editing capability as would one stored on ArcGIS Server. After this change, our editing applications worked fine, and our simple configurations allowed attribute changes to the trails.
