            <h1> Step 1: Outlining the Goals and Individual Development using ArcGIS Dashboards
            </h1>
            <p>
                Most of our team had familiarity with Dashboards through previous coursework, but were keen to dive in and
                explore further functionality applied to this problem. After discussing our broad goals for what we needed it to
                show, we each
                configured our own dashboards in parallel. This allowed each group member to work creatively and come up with
                their own solutions. After this individual exploration we came together as a team to compare and discuss what
                we'd discovered,
                and apply the best traits on a final product.

                Through exploring the widgets that dashboard offers I found that the most useful tool was the “Actions” ability
                found in the settings of the widgets. This allows users to make filters more observable on the map and allows
                communication between widgets. This was especially useful for showing individual trails and how many trails were
                open within specific categories through connecting the indicator widgets with pie chart or list widgets. These
                actions make information much clearer and simpler for users to interpret and were very easy to implement,
                however some added functionality such as changing the size of the flash would be a good improvement to the
                software. The customization of color also allowed for very precise design, as every element of the dashboard
                including the scroll bars was customizable. Having the ability to use HEX code for the colors allowed for a very
                wide array of hues to be used and lead to a much more coordinated design.

            The two things I did to customize my dashboard were:
        </p>
        <p class="lianneheader">Current Weather Widget</p>
        <p>
            Working on this widget, which failed completely, reinforced what I learned about configuration, customization
            and development. The platforms we chose (ESRI) involved a lot of configuration, but wherever I wanted to do some
            development, like adding a geoJSON link where the daily weather would automatically pop up on the Dashboard, I
            ran into big issues with ESRI products simply being a commercial off the shelf product. They’re not very
            compatible with adding and removing little bits of code for some sort of custom widget. All in all, for a simple
            app I think configuration is the way to go. But wherever the data gets a bit more complicated, or you are
            sourcing data from several different open-source websites, like with my weather or where there are more
            sophisticated integrations, it’s better not to use ESRI products and to instead use an open-source software that
            allows for development.

        <p class="lianneheader">Trail Obstacles Layer</p>
        <p>
            This layer was a huge success. Field maps is easy to use, quick to configure, and so simple that anyone can set
            it up and then use it without knowing any programming. This reinforced another main thing I learned throughout
            this project - ESRI products are extremely simple and intuitive in terms of adding widgets, adding fields, and
            creating layers. A lot of the logic of where to find different fields follows the layout and options that
            existing in ArcMap and ArcPro so translating your ArcMap skills into ArcGIS online is easy.

        <p>
            Of all the web GIS solutions that we explored, I found Dashboards to be the most well suited in presenting the
            trail information we wanted. My original vision for the dashboard was to provide a list of open trails, as well
            as number of trail type that, when clicked, would highlight the trails on the main map (symbolized by status).
            Since the data we were given was incomplete, a large portion of my time was spent correcting and assigning
            values to the fields, especially the status and trail names. The issue I ran into while creating the dashboard
            was that I was able to configure selection actions with the list but not with the indicators that provided
            activity trail numbers. This provided less functionality with the indicators and meant cluttering the dashboard
            if I wanted to include a way for users to select by trail acivity type. My main takeaway from experimenting with
            Dashboards is that the user interface, while easy and generally customizable, it is not suited for more specific
            selection functionalities. Something I would like to have been able to do for all widgets are selection actions.
            I ultimately decided against adding more widgets to keep true to the problem solution, which was to display
            trail status and hazards (which was added in our final dashboard).

        </h2>
        <p>
            I found one simple but effective solution to be incorporate into the dashboard was the rich text box as a
            notification
            board for staff to describe hazards or closures present. This written
            forum gives more flexibility to present information not explicitly symbolized in the map data, and effectively
            takes the
            place of the written notification currently on the GRCA website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Second, I found that using pie charts to symbolize attributes for a given map with a matching colour scheme
            can function as a clear and effective legend. Not only does this negate the need for including a separate legend
            with the map, but that chart can be used to filter trails of each type, adding more functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, having 2 maps stacked on top of each other with tabs to toggle between them was a good use of space,
            and a
            given pie chart legend can be connected to its related map for filtering. However, such stacked maps looked
            unprofessional if the maps were not at the exact same position - even a slight shift in position while switching
            maps
            is distracting for the user. The easiest fix for this was to create one map with a given symbology, then
            resymbolizing
            it by the other attribute and saving that as a second map without touching the map position at all. As long as
            neither map's
            position is changed after that time, you should be okay.

            After our individual development the team came together to determine which aspects we most liked out of each
            member’s product. Our top features were:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rich text box for notices</li>
            <li>List of trails by name and status, linked to the map to show their location</li>
            <li>Attractive notification panels showing number of open trails by activity</li>
            <li>Adding in an additional point layer of user-reported trail hazards, symbolized by type and filtered by a
                list</li>
        </ul>
