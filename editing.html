            <h1> Step 1: Exploring editing applications
            </h1>
            <p>
                As we are designing this project for GRCA who have ESRI licencing, we explored the ESRI options for editing
                spatial data.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Web AppBuilder
            </h2>
                <p>
                    A desktop-friendly application, it has a few easily configurable widgets with editing capabilities. The
                    best of
                    these for our purposes was the Batch Attribute Editor, which allows selection and editing of many
                    features from
                    multiple layers using various shape-based selectors. The simplicity of the widgets makes it very easy
                    to quickly make updates to several trails at once. Configuring the Web AppBuilder is as simple as connecting the
                     app to a given web map and choosing which feature layers (and fields within those layers) to allow the app to edit, 
                     provided those layers were published with editing capabilities already.
                </p>
                <p>
                     Unfortunately, this application is based on the older Javascript API and will be discontinued in the future. 
                     The new ArcGIS Experience Builder based on the latest version of the Javascript API does not have
                      editing functionality as of yet, so Web AppBuilder is our desktop-friendly application option. Another desktop alternative, 
                      is Esriâ€™s new web Map Viewer, which has capability to edit directly on the map from within the viewer. However,
                       this editing lacks the batch editing of the Web AppBuilder. So if Web AppBuilder is discontinued the map viewer can act 
                       as a desktop substitute. Perhaps in the future batch attribute editing will be added to this or ESRI's Field Maps, as we'll 
                       discuss next.

        <p>
            This mobile app combines a lot of functionality for in-the-field use, including offline map viewing,
            data
            collection and editing. The editing is also as simple as loading in a map, selecting individual
            features
            and
            editing their attributes. One downside is that it is geared towards the editing of features one by
            one as is common for inspections, so does not have the same ease of batch editing functionality as 
            the Web AppBuilder.

        <h1>Step 2: Making an Editable Layer
        </h1>
        <p>
            The initial goal for this application is to update a trail layer stored on ArcGIS Server as a
            feature
            service.
            There are two ways to publish an editable feature service:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Setting the Feature capabilities on the layer when publishing it from ArcGIS Pro</li>
            <li>Changing the service capabilities after publishing through the ArcGIS Server Manager</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            After trying both of these avenues and ensuring that both the ArcGIS Online item and web map linked
            to that
            feature service supported editing, our team was still unable to edit our layer with any of our editing
            applications. We tried uploading the data as a Hosted Feature Service on ArcGIS Online and our apps worked fine, 
            so we determined it was some connection issue with our feature service. After much googling, experimening and 
            frustration, a question to Shawn reveiled our stumbling 
            block: a feature service must be based on data stored on an Enterprise geodatabase to allow editing on the web services! 
            One referencing data stored on a file geodatabase does not. A critical oversight!
        </p>
        <p>
            For the purposes of this course focused the web development side (and not necessarily working with enterprise 
            geodatabases), we decided continue to explore editing with these apps on our Hosted Feature Service. The behaviour of
            a hosted layer is the same as one on server with the proper permissions set, and after adopting this workflow our
             editing applications worked fine, and our simple configurations allowed attribute changes to the trails.
