    <h1> Step 1: Exploring editing applications
    </h1>
    <p>
        As we are designing this project for GRCA who have ESRI licencing, we explored the ESRI options for editing
        spatial data.
    </p>

    <h2>Web AppBuilder
    </h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            A desktop-friendly application, it has a few easily configurable widgets with editing capabilities. The
            best of
            these for our purposes was the Batch Attribute Editor, which allows selection and editing of many
            features from
            multiple layers using various shape-based selectors. The simplicity of the widgets makes it very easy
            to quickly make updates to several trails at once. Configuring the Web AppBuilder is as simple as connecting the
             app to a given web map and choosing which feature layers (and fields within those layers) to allow the app to edit, 
             provided those layers were published with editing capabilities already.
        </p>
        <p>
             Unfortunately, this application is based on the older Javascript API and will be discontinued in the future. 
             The new ArcGIS Experience Builder based on the latest version of the Javascript API does not have
              editing functionality as of yet, so Web AppBuilder is our desktop-friendly application option. Another desktop alternative, 
              is Esri’s new web Map Viewer, which has capability to edit directly on the map from within the viewer. However,
               this editing lacks the batch editing of the Web AppBuilder. So if Web AppBuilder is discontinued the map viewer can act 
               as a desktop substitute. Perhaps in the future batch attribute editing will be added to this or ESRI's Field Maps, as we'll 
               discuss next.

    <h2>Field Maps
    </h2>
    <p>
        This mobile app combines a lot of functionality for in-the-field use, including offline map viewing,
        data
        collection and editing. The editing is also as simple as loading in a map, selecting individual
        features
        and
        editing their attributes. One downside is that it is geared towards the editing of features one by
        one as is common for inspections, so does not have the same ease of batch editing functionality as 
        the Web AppBuilder.

    <h1>Step 2: Making an editable layer
    </h1>
    <p>
        The initial goal for this application is to update a trail layer stored on ArcGIS Server as a
        feature
        service.
        There are two ways to publish an editable feature service:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Setting the Feature capabilities on the layer when publishing it from ArcGIS Pro</li>
        <li>Changing the service capabilities after publishing through the ArcGIS Server Manager</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        After trying both of these avenues and ensuring that both the ArcGIS Online item and web map linked
        to that
        feature service supported editing, our team was still able to edit our layer with any of our editing
        applications. After some frustration, we learned that a feature service must be stored on an
        Enterprise
        geodatabase to allow editing on the web – services stored in a file geodatabase do not. A critical
        step!
    </p>
    <p>
        For the purposes of this course based on the web development side, we decided to instead host our
        feature layer
        on ArcGIS Online which allows the same editing capability as would one stored on ArcGIS Server.
        After
        this
        change, our editing applications worked fine, and our simple configurations allowed attribute
        changes to
        the
        trails.
