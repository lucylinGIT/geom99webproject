    <h1> Step 1: Exploring editing applications
    </h1>
    <p>
        As we are designing this project for GRCA who have ESRI licencing, we explored the ESRI options for editing
        spatial data.
    </p>

    <h2>Web AppBuilder
    </h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            A desktop-friendly application, it has a few easily configurable widgets with editing capabilities. The
            best of
            these for our purposes was the Batch Attribute Editor, which allows selection and editing of many
            features from
            multiple layers using various shape-based selectors. The simplicity of the widgets makes it very easy
            for a
            staff member to quickly create updates to several trails at once without having to sort through data as
            using
            the Web AppBuilder is as simple as connecting the app to a given web map and choosing which feature
            layers and fields within those layers on which editing is allowed.
            Unfortunately, this application is based on the older Javascript API and will be discontinued in the
            future. The
            new ArcGIS Experience Builder based on the latest version of the Javascript API does not have editing
            functionality as of yet, so Web AppBuilder is our desktop-friendly option. In addition, with the update
            to
            Esri’s web maps they are capable editing directly on the map so the use of a web app will likely be
            unnecessary
            for the purposes of editing.

    <h2>Field Maps
    </h2>
    <p>
        This mobile app combines a lot of functionality for in-the-field use, including offline map viewing,
        data
        collection and editing. The editing is also as simple as loading in a map, selecting individual
        features
        and
        editing their attributes. One downside is that it is geared towards the editing of features one by
        one
        like for
        inspections, so does not have the same batch editing functionality as the web AppBuilder.

    <h1>Step 2: Making an editable layer
    </h1>
    <p>
        The initial goal for this application is to update a trail layer stored on ArcGIS Server as a
        feature
        service.
        There are two ways to publish an editable feature service:
    <p class="points">
        1) Setting the Feature capabilities on the layer when publishing it from ArcGIS Pro
        <br>
        2) Changing the service capabilities after publishing through the ArcGIS Server Manager
    </p>
    <p>
        After trying both of these avenues and ensuring that both the ArcGIS Online item and web map linked
        to
        that
        feature service supported editing, our team was still able to edit our layer with any of our editing
        applications. After some frustration, we learned that a feature service must be stored on an
        Enterprise
        geodatabase to allow editing on the web – services stored in a file geodatabase do not. A critical
        step!
        <br>
        For the purposes of this course based on the web development side, we decided to instead host our
        feature layer
        on ArcGIS Online which allows the same editing capability as would one stored on ArcGIS Server.
        After
        this
        change, our editing applications worked fine, and our simple configurations allowed attribute
        changes to
        the
        trails.
